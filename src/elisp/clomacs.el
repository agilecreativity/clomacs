;;; Commentary

;; `clomacs-ensure-nrepl-runnig' - Ensures nrepl is runnig. If not, launch it,
;; return nil. Return t otherwise.
;; `clomacs-load' Evaluate clojure side, run startup initialization
;; functions.
;; `clomacs-defun' - core clojure to elisp function wrapper.
;;
;; There are some requirements to run mixed elisp-clojure code:
;; 1. clomacs elisp code should be loaded:
;;    (require 'clomacs)
;; 2. nrepl must run.
;;    (clomacs-launch-nrepl)
;; 3. clomacs clojure-side code should be loaded:
;;    (clomacs-init)
;; 4. custom elisp code should be loaded:
;;    (require '<custom>)
;; 5. user's java/clojure custom libraries should be added to the CLASSPATH:
;;    TODO: load *.jar libs
;; 6. user's custom clojure code should be added to the CLASSPATH:
;;    (clomacs-load <clojure-side-file>)
;;
;; So, the user of the mixed elisp-clojure lib wants to simple run elisp code.
;; At this point no one of this terms perhaps unsupplied or supplied some of
;; them (or even all of them).
